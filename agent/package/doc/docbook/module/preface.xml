		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>Sapo-Broker is a distributed messaging framework.	Among other features, it provides minimal administration overhead, Publish-Subscribe, Request-Reply and Point-to-Point messaging, guaranteed delivery and wildcard subscriptions.</para>
		<para>Sapo-Broker is written in Java and has client libraries for Java, Perl, Python, PHP, .NET and C.</para>

			<title>Supported broker topologies</title>
			<para>
				Sapo-Broker can be used as a single instance or in a multi-node cluster.
				Although a single agent instance could be used in small working sets, a multiple agent (network) design would better take advantage of Sapo-Broker, namely in system availability and throughput, with client failover and distributed workload, respectively.
				In a multi-node scenario all agents are interconnected in what is known as agent cloud. It is not yet possible to communicate between different clouds.

			<title>Message publication and subscription</title>
			<para>
				Like Java Message Service (<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/">JMS</ulink>) we use the terms "TOPIC" to refer Publish-Subscribe messaging and "QUEUE" to designate Point-to-Point messaging.
			</para>
			<para>
				There is no way, nor need, to create a "QUEUE" or "TOPIC" before any client can consume or produce messages. The "QUEUE" or "TOPIC" is created on the fly, as clients subscribe to it. Note that a typo in the "QUEUE" name, in the subscription operation, can lead to two different queues, in a way that the consumer will try to read from a forever empty queue, and the producer will write to a never read queue.
			</para>
			<section>
				<title id="INTRO_PUBSUB">Topics</title>
				<para>
					Messages published to "TOPIC"s are delivered to any consumer which has a subscription name that matches the Destination name (topic subscriptions can have regular expressions).
					There are no provisions for message persistence when using Topics and slow consumer will force the broker to discard messages.
				</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title id="INTRO_POINT2POINT">Queues</title>
				<para>
					Queues implement reliable load balancing (a message is delivered to only one consumer).
					Messages are persisted to disk and are only removed from the Queue after the broker receives an acknowledgement, unacknowledged messages are redelivered after 2 minutes.
				</para>
			
				<section>
					<title id="INTRO_VIRTUAL_QUEUES">Virtual Queues</title>
					<para>
						Events published as TOPIC messages are not persisted and QUEUE messages once consumed by a client can not be consumed by another, this means that if there are two systems interested in the same messages they can not subscribe to the same Queue.
					</para>
					<para>
						To overcome these handicaps Sapo-Broker supports a VIRTUAL_QUEUE Destination Type.
						When clients subscribe to a topic as a Virtual Queue an ordinary queue is created and all topic messages whose Destination Name match the subscription are stored in the created queue.
					</para>
					<para>The subscription for a Virtual Queues has the form:</para>
					<code>[private name]@[topic subscription pattern]</code>
					<para>
						An example could be: <code>myVirtualQueue@/topic/.*</code>
					</para>
					<para>Please note that the private names must be unique. Also note that can exist several Virtual Queues for the same topic or subscription pattern.</para>
