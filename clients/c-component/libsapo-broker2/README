New libsapo-broker2, a C client library for sapo-broker.


Tentative Features:
 - Support several comunication protocols by design.
 - Support multiple servers for failover and load balancing.
 - Gracefully handle network & broker failures.
 - FAST, lightweight, thread-safe and pleasant API.

WHAT WORKS NOW:
    - uses PROTOCOL BUFFERS for the comunication protocol
    - supports 2 transport protocols:
       - TCP
       - UDP (for sending only, broker limitation)
    - Publish to TOPIC
    - Enqueue to QUEUES
    - Subscribe to QUEUE, with auto-acknowledge (or not),
    - Subscribe to TOPIC
    - broker_receive():
        blocking reception of messages, can specify timeout.
        message indicates which:
            topic/queue the message belongs
            server
            if it was already acked or not.
    - multiple server support:
        - basic fail-over for sending:
            it tries servers in order, stops trying on success.
        - if failures are reported during comunication with a given server,
            at most 3 reconnect are tried,
            after that, it tries diferent server.
    - thread safe

TODO:
    - Handle disconnects better:
        - on disconnect, re-subscribe current topics in (some other) accessible broker.
    - POLL support
    - Handle to user PONG/FAULT/* messages from Broker.
    - Better support for multiple servers:
        - balance enqueues or publishes through ALL servers
        - subscribe to topics/queues in ALL servers.
    - support adicional features:
        - priorities?
        - expiration times
        - action_id
    - support assyncronous API with callbacks.
    - comunication protocols:
        - THRIFT (patches are welcome)
        - SOAP (patches are welcome)
